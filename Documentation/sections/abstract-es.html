<h2>S&iacute;ntesis</h2><span class="markdown">
This ontology gathers the schemes in scope of POSTDATA Network of Ontologies. Each SKOS is a concept scheme that controls the possible values of several properties defined across the network to describe different aspects of poetic works.

In this ontology we gather a full set of concepts and their respective concept schemes, including reused concepts if applicable. In the context of POSTDATA Project, this set of concepts is subjected to modifications that may be required to enhance the global comprehension or consistency of the scheme.

Between the SKOS that are prone to include modifications, we find the folliwng:
- Genre
- Literary Period
- Stanza Type
- Metrical type</span>
